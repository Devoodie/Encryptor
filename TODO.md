- Edit success message to show how many files were actually successfully encrypted/decrypted
- Allow help command to target specific commands
- Add recursiveness to file encryption
- Check that files to decrypt have .ses extension before attempting decryption
- Append .ses files with seed before encryption to ensure the data retention during decryption
- Add user ability to change seed length
- Add updater that checks github for newer releases
